        <h3>Web Design & Development</h3>
        <p>I began programming last year in 2018 when I started majoring in MIS beginning
          with Python and then moved on to SQL/database management through the progression of my degree plan.
          My interest in programming, coding, web development, or whatever you want to call it, started in highschool.
          Although, I didn't really have a chance to pursue it I got to college.

        <h3>Entrepreneurship & Leadership</h3>
        <p>My entrepreneurial journey started in the 6th grade when I started selling Old Fashion Candy Company products
          during the school day to my classmates. I've come a long way, and I still have a long way to go.
          I am currently working on my first startup Loop as the CEO, a marketplace for freelance college students where entrepreneurs can outsource projects.
          Loop is currently a work in progress, while we iterate and build, I am working on build my skills in leadership, public speaking, sales, marketing, and UX/UI design.</p>
